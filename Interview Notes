Object Oriented Programming

OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, rather than functions or logic.

An object is an instance of a class, which bundles data (fields/attributes) and behaviour (methods/functions) together.

OOP is a methodology for designing and building software using objects that interact with each other, modelling real-world entities,
and encapsulating data and behaviour.

There are four main pillars of OOP:

1. Encapsulation

Definition: Hiding the internal state of an object and providing controlled access via methods.

Benefit: Improves security and maintainability.

2.  Abstraction

Definition: Hiding implementation details and exposing only essential functionality.

Benefit: Lets you program to interfaces/abstract types, not specific implementations.

3.  Inheritance

Definition: Mechanism by which one class (subclass) acquires fields and methods of another class (superclass).

Benefit: Promotes code reuse and a hierarchical relationship.

4.  Polymorphism

Definition: Ability of an object to take many forms; the same method call can behave differently depending on the object.

Benefit: Enhances flexibility and extensibility.





---- Shallow Copy and Deep Copy -------------


A shallow copy of an object is a copy where the fields of the object are copied as-is, including references.
In other words, the top-level object is duplicated, but the objects it refers to are not; 
they are shared between the original and the copy.

Only the references are copied, not the actual objects they point to.
Modifying a nested object in the copy will affect the original.

A deep copy of an object is a copy where all objects are duplicated recursively, not just the top-level object.
The copy and the original are completely independent, including all nested objects.

Modifying the copy does not affect the original.
