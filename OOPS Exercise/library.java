Inheritance

One class (child/subclass) acquires properties and methods of another class (parent/superclass).

Achieved with extends keyword.

Industry benefit: Code reuse, extensibility.

/*

Polymorphism

Ability of the same method to behave differently based on context.

Compile-time polymorphism â†’ method overloading.

Runtime polymorphism â†’ method overriding.

Industry benefit: Flexibility, scalability.
