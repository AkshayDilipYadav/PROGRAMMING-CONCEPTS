Concurrency vs Parallelism

Concurrency: Structuring a program as independent tasks (not necessarily simultaneous).

Parallelism: Actually running tasks at the same time on multiple cores.

Concurrency

Definition: Concurrency is the ability of a system to manage multiple tasks at the same time, but not necessarily simultaneously.

In Java: Multiple threads or tasks can make progress independently (time-slicing on a single CPU), even if only one executes at a time.


Parallelism

Definition: Parallelism is the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks on multiple processors or cores.

In Java: Multiple threads execute at the same exact time on multiple cores.

Key point: All parallel programs are concurrent, but not all concurrent programs are parallel.
