Synchronous vs Asynchronous Execution

Sync: One task must finish before the next begins.

Async: Tasks can proceed without waiting for others.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Synchronous Execution

Definition: In synchronous execution, tasks are performed one after another. Each task must complete before the next task starts.

In Java: A method call that blocks the caller until it finishes is synchronous.


Asynchronous Execution

Definition: In asynchronous execution, tasks are initiated and the caller does not wait for them to complete. Tasks may complete later, independently of the caller.

In Java: Tasks run in a separate thread, or with CompletableFuture, ExecutorService, or other async APIs.

Key point: Synchronous = blocking, Asynchronous = non-blocking
